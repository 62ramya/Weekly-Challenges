<title><![CDATA[Borscht - Cold Beetroot Soup]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[This is one the great Jewish standbys of the deli trade. If you are pressed for time and do not want to boil raw beetroots, use two jars of the borscht available in jars in supermarkets. That is what I often do.]]></description>

<step><![CDATA[Peel the beetroots and dice them. If they are young that is easy to do. (If they are old and too hard to cut, simply cut them in half and when they have softened with boiling, lift them out, cut them up and put them back in the pan). Put the beetroots in a pan with 2 litres of water and salt and pepper and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Let the soup cool then chill, covered, in the refrigerator. Add the lemon and sugar to taste before serving (these could be added when the soup is hot but it is more difficult to decide the intensity of the flavouring). Remove some of the beetroot pieces with a slotted spoon if they seem too much and keep them for a salad.]]></step>
<step><![CDATA[Serve, if you like, with a boiled potato, putting one in each plate. Pass round the sour cream for everyone to help themselves.]]></step>
